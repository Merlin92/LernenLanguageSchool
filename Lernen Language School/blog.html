                <h3>Why study German?</h3>
                <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#blog1" class="fa-btn btn-1 btn-1e">read more</button><br>
                <span class="para">
                    Wer die Wahl hat, hat die Qual - The bigger the choice, the harder it is to choose<br><br>
                    My philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn English (barring spelling and pronouncing) in thirty hours, French in thirty days, and German in thirty years. It seems manifest, then, that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired. If it is to remain as it is, it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages, for only the dead have time to learn it.<br>
                    <span class="collapse" id="blog1">
                        <br>
                        Learning German is no mean feat, and the life of a Germanistik student is certainly no Ponyhof*, if Mark Twain’s denunciations are anything to go by.<br>
                        Yet, in an academic climate where arts degrees seem to be discredited as dubious and directionless endeavours, I feel it important to encourage and exalt the study of languages and literature.
                        <br><br>
                        As I write this, thousands of 17 and 18 year old high-schoolers are mulling over their university choices. They are weighing up parental expectations, grade predictions, personal interests and skills and making their first steps towards university life and ultimately, towards their careers.<br>
                        As someone who knows this confusion all too well, let me argue in defence of the study of Deutsch.
                        <br><br>
                        I embarked on my quest towards German fluency four years ago at Trinity College Dublin. Needless to say, my first year was a blur of speedily scribbled homework assignments, disastrous grammar tests and gruesome hangovers.<br>
                        After two semesters of coasting along, relying on my fortuitous pronunciation, and allowing linguistic improvements to stagnate entirely, I was more or less ready to quit.
                        <br><br>
                        What was I really learning this for? What would it bring me to trawl through pages of pointless grammatical phrases, when so many of my peers were studying towards real, tangible careers in engineering, pharmacy and medicine?
                        <br><br>
                        However, deciding that I hadn't really given it a chance, I chose to persevere and found myself several months later at the University of Cologne as part of the Erasmus exchange programme.<br>
                        Aware that my first attempt at student life had involved a lot more gin and ice-cream than it possibly should have, and much too little attendance and hard work, I resolved that my semester abroad would be different;<br>
                        gin and ice-cream would be replaced by beer and Bretzeln. More importantly, I would attend all my classes and study a lot harder. The latter proved to be not so difficult, as the German University system simply does not allow for poor attendance - miss more than three classes and you fail; end of story.
                        <br><br>
                        Thus, as a result of both internal and external pressures, I began to really delve into my studies for the first time. I realised how interesting and rewarding it could be to stop questioning what financial or career-based rewards might be reaped from a degree, and to start learning for pleasure.<br>
                        Speaking out in class was both terrifying and exhilarating. On the one hand, formulating academic arguments in German was an elaborate exercise, requiring quite a bit of mental effort. On the other hand, expressing myself somewhat eloquently to a class of native speakers was exciting and rewarding and made me feel like a spritely arthurian Parzival, hot on the heels of the holy grail.
                        <br><br>
                        A couple of years later, and I’ve graduated from Trinity, having spent my final year suitably stressed but totally enthused about all things German. The vast and varied spectrum of potential study available to language graduands meant that my course introduced me to feminist literature, magic realism, vampiric texts and necrophilia (yes really - I’m looking at you, Goethe...)<br>
                        fables, fairy tales, unicorns and so much more. I discovered that, from the moment my enthusiasm had truly been awakened in a crowded lecture theatre in Cologne, the study of German brought with it a wealth of exciting cultural knowledge, from intriguing texts and works of art to theatre, film and poetry.
                        <br><br>
                        Most importantly though, it brought me to where I am today in the heart of the German Capital. I intern with artists during the week and am currently spending this Sunday evening sitting in my gorgeous Altbau room in the centre of this wonderful city, breathing in the festive scent of Glühwein and
                        Plätzchen and feeling that life is very very schön. Who needs a ‘real’ degree?
                        <br><br>

                    Be intentional about your study abroad experience. Force yourself to get in the habit of doing small things to purposefully engage in the target language.

                        This can mean a lot of different things. Some research suggests that you should keep a study abroad diary in the target language to log your daily experiences without worrying about grammar or spelling. Reflecting on your daily life in the language can really make a huge difference in your learning experience. When I was studying abroad for the first time, I kept a mini spiral-bound notebook in my purse to write down new words that I wanted to remember. The act of writing them down helped me learn the words and phrases much faster than I would have by just hearing them in passing. I would make sure to actively use my new vocabulary as much as possible until it was integrated into my regular vocabulary in the target language. My vocabulary increased exponentially by practicing this type of active learning. Technology has changed a lot, however, since I was a high school study abroad student. Now there are online tools to help you learn vocabulary even more effectively. There are many databases full of vocabulary that you can practice through online apps. Brainscape even has some optimized flashcards that you can use in much the same way that I used my notebook in a study abroad context. Instead of writing down new vocabulary in a notebook, you could simply add words to your customized Brainscape flashcard deck using their app on your phone until you have the words down pat.

                <h3>How to Survive Your First Cold Winter in Ireland</h3>
                <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#blog3" class="fa-btn btn-1 btn-1e">read more</button><br>
                <span class="para">
                    If you’re an international student in Ireland and you are preparing for a cold winter then it’s best to prepare now- especially if you’ve never experienced cold weather.
                    <br>Here are a few tips on how to survive your first cold winter.
                    <br>
                    <span class="para collapse" id="blog3">
                        <br>
                        <strong>1. Accessorize Smarter:</strong> accessories are not just for fashion, especially in temperatures below freezing.
                        <br><br>Here are a few items you’ll need:
                        <br><br>
                        Water resistant shoes- where there’s cold weather there’s also snow, ice and sleet. Since having wet feet is sure to amplify each cool breeze that blows through, its best to keep your toes dry and warm.
                        A glove, hat and scarf trio- these three small items can make a big difference when it comes to handling the cold. Without a hat you risk losing a lot of body heat, without gloves you risk not being able to move your fingers, and without a scarf you will feel every slight breeze or snowflake on the back of your neck.
                        An insulated coat- not all coats are made equal. If you’re studying somewhere with truly freezing temperatures then investing in a thick winter coat will be worth the money.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>2. Plot a plan of attack:</strong> when walking to and from class make sure you walk wisely. Take shortcuts when possible and walk through other buildings along the way.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>3. Prevent getting sick:</strong> cold weather and illness often go hand in hand. Although vitamins can’t guarantee you won’t get sick it will certainly help boost your immune system to give you a fighting chance. Also, practice good hygiene by washing your hands frequently, especially before eating.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>4. Travel carefully:</strong> if you’ll be driving during your time as an international student make sure you’re well informed on how to drive in cold weather. For example: bridges will freeze before other areas of the road and black ice means roads can be icy even without appearing to be.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>5. Stay informed:</strong> in areas that get dangerous during cold weather it’s important to stay informed. Keep tabs on the local weather alerts along with campus alerts.

                <h3>How learning a language could limit terrorism</h3>
                <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#blog4" class="fa-btn btn-1 btn-1e">read more</button><br>
                <span class="para">
                    In the early parts of this year, the news was full of coverage of the terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels, Turkey and Iraq. 
                    <br>
                    <span class="para collapse" id="blog4">
                        <br>
                        Understandably, our government has become increasingly worried about the possibility of another terrorist attack happening in Britain, and as a University student I was interested to see whether the government was making any special effort to change the education system to try and prevent the radicalisation of school children. After a quick search, I found that David Cameron had committed £20 million to teach Muslim women already in the UK the English language. 
                        As an English and Languages student, this caught my attention, and the logic behind this investment seems sound. 
                        If Muslim women are taught to speak English fluently, they can then get more involved in their communities and make more social contacts outside of their non-English speaking group of friends. 
                        This may turn them away from radicalisation, as they can then see Britain’s liberal culture as an acceptable alternative rather than believe the hate-speech of radical preachers. 
                        However the key target of this policy appears to be young British Muslim children, who are particularly vulnerable to radicalisation. 
                        It is hoped that if their mothers can speak English and are further removed from the potential extremist views then they will also be less likely to turn to radicalisation. 
                        This policy has also sparked controversy however, as others are keen to point out that mothers will instil good morals and valued into their children regardless of their ability to speak English. 
                        Either way, this scheme shows the value that politicians give language, as a way of understanding others and breaking down cultural barriers. 
                        This rings true with my experience of learning languages as it certainly makes it easier to communicate with and understand those who come from different backgrounds to yourself. 
                        Maybe the key to fighting terrorism lies not in hyped-up rhetoric or increased levels of violence, but in sustained efforts to ensure that those most vulnerable to radicalisation are dissuaded from that path – whether that be through the use of language or other means.
