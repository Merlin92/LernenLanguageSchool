                    Fremdsprache; DaF) and German as a second language (Deutsch als
                    Zweitsprache; DaZ) for over 60 years. We offer you a comprehensive

                    If you become a language teacher you must be fluent in both English and
                    your target language.
                    In addition, you will be required to teach your students about the
                    culture and history of the countries where the language is spoken.
                    Whatever language you teach, here are a few duties you can expect as an
                    elementary or secondary language education teacher:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Handling day-to-day needs, such as preparing lesson plans and
                            correcting student work
                        </li>

                            classroom

                        <li>
                            Organizing special events related to your language and culture
                            classes, such as dance performances, cultural displays,
                            target-language dinners and other events

                    As a language teacher, you may travel from classroom to classroom, or you
                    may have your own room, depending on your school or district size. A
                    growing trend in public and private education today is language immersion
                    schools, where students attend all or some core classes such as math,
                    social studies and language arts in another language all year long.

                    motivated whilst learning. Our ethos is to make learning an enjoyable
                    experience. Our teachers use interactive teaching methods
                    through games, role play, using video, internet & other cultural media to
                    enhance speaking & listening, with the aim of instilling confidence &
                    competence in the practice of learning German. Students are expected to
                    work hard & actively take part in their classes. We remind students of
                    the positive outcomes of attaining a higher standard of competency in
                    German such as positive impaction on future employment.
