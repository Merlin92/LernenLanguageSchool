                                <strong>Who can participate in the Language Courses for Young People program?</strong><br>
                                Our language courses for young people program is built for teenagers and young adults between 14 and 21 years of years who want to learn a foreign language course with their own peer group while taking a trip abroad. Each program destination specializes in specific age groups, which means that the students are always put into groups with their peers.

                                    What's involved in the Language Courses for Young People program?
                                </strong><br>
                                Our Courses for Young People program teaches students language skills in a relaxed learning atmosphere, without the boredom or stress of everyday school life. The initial uncertainty of being in a new place, learning a new language, goes away quickly and then learning grammar and vocabulary becomes fun - Mainly because the students don’t have to do it alone, rather they get to learn with old and new friends!
                                <br><br>
                                In the afternoons, we offer a variable recreational program, which gradually introduces the juniors to the country, its people and its culture.<br>
                                Participants will travel supervised and supported during the language program according to their age.
